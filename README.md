This is a project I worked on with [Iotaslair](https://github.com/Iotaslair) for our Augmented Reality class. This app is an Android Application built with Sceneform.

Our app takes the idea of a quiz app and applies Augmented Reality to it. First you scan an image in the real world, or you can find the images in the images folder. Once you get the question right you get an AR sticker which you can place in the real world to take a picture with. Find a flat surface so you can place the sticker, once the white dots show up place the sticker by clicking where you want to place it after you've chosen what sticker you want.
